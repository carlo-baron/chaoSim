# 🌌 chaoSim

> A C# application using **SFML.Net** that simulates chaos games to generate beautiful fractal patterns like the Sierpiński triangle and Vicsek fractal.

---

## 🧩 Description

**chaoSim** is a simple yet fascinating simulation tool that visualizes how randomness and geometry combine to form ordered patterns — fractals.
Built with **C#** and **SFML.Net**, it recreates several classic and experimental chaos games, slowly plotting each point to reveal their hidden structures in real time.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

This project began as a passion experiment — built with little programming experience but a lot of curiosity about how chaos leads to order.
Every fractal you see emerge from randomness reflects that journey: from confusion to structure, from learning to mastery.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Make sure you have the **.NET SDK** installed on your system.
If you don’t have it yet, download it from [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Then clone and run the project:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/carlo-baron/chaoSim.git

# Move into the project directory
cd chaoSim

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

You can also open the project directly in **Visual Studio** or **VS Code**
and start the simulation from there.

Also this might not work on operating system that is not windows, and I don't know how to fix it yet so sorry in advance :(

## 🕹️ Usage

1. Launch the app with `dotnet run`.
2. You’ll see a **Start** and **Quit** button.
3. Click **Start** to open the fractal selection screen.
4. Choose any base shape (e.g. Triangle, Square, Pentagon).
5. The base shape will appear — click anywhere on the window to start the simulation.
6. Watch as up to **50,000 iterations** gradually reveal the fractal pattern.
7. Use the **Back** button (top-right corner) to return to the selection screen.
